# Frontend Design Protocols

## Goal
Create creative, polished frontend interfaces that are memorable and production-ready.

## Design Thinking Phase
Before coding, define a **BOLD** aesthetic direction:
- **Tone Examples:** Brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, luxury/refined, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, soft/pastel, industrial.
- **Differentiation:** Identify one unforgettable feature.
- **Intentionality:** Boldness comes from execution, not necessarily intensity.

## Aesthetics Guidelines

### 1. Typography
- **Avoid Defaults:** No Arial, Inter, or Roboto.
- **Pairing:** Combine a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

### 2. Color & Theme
- **Accents:** Use dominant colors with sharp, impactful accents rather than evenly distributed palettes.
- **CSS Variables:** Use variables to ensure a cohesive theme.

### 3. Motion & Interactivity
- **Priority:** Use CSS-only animations when possible. Use Motion (Framer Motion) for React if available.
- **Impact:** One well-orchestrated sequence (e.g., staggered page load) is better than many scattered interactions.
- **Triggers:** Use scroll-triggering and hover states to surprise and delight.

### 4. Spatial Composition
- **Layouts:** Use unexpected layouts—asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, and grid-breaking elements.
- **Negative Space:** Use generous whitespace OR controlled density to define the experience.

### 5. Depth & Texture
- **Atmosphere:** Avoid solid colors; use atmosphere-building details.
- **Techniques:** Use gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, and grain overlays.

## Prohibition
- **NO AI SLOP:** Never use overused font families, cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white), or cookie-cutter component patterns.
- **Variation:** Each design must be unique. Never converge on the same aesthetic across different projects.

## Execution
Match code complexity to the vision. High-maximalism requires elaborate animations and effects; refined minimalism requires extreme precision in spacing and typography.
