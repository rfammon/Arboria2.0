# Product Brief: ArborIA 3.0

**Vision**
The ArborIA platform transforms from an individual tree management tool into a professional **multi-tenant tree management platform**, enabling multiple facilities (industrial plants, municipalities, corporate campuses) to use the same technical infrastructure while maintaining complete data isolation and independent teams.

**Problem**
*   **Lack of Standardization:** Industrial facilities depend on specialized service providers with inconsistent quality.
*   **Operational Risk:** Accidents with trees compromise corporate safety and sustainability images.
*   **Technical Gap:** Managers without forestry engineering training make critical safety decisions.
*   **Legacy Limitation:** The current system isolates data by individual user, preventing collaboration.

**Solution**
A SaaS multi-tenant platform that:
1.  **Democratizes Expertise:** Encodes forestry engineering knowledge into an intuitive tool.
2.  **Standardizes Excellence:** Enforces rigorous technical methodology (15 weighted risk criteria).
3.  **Enables Collaboration:** Allows teams to work together with granular execution profiles.
4.  **Ensures Security:** Total isolation between facilities using Row Level Security (RLS).

**Strategic Goals**
*   Migrate legacy JavaScript functionality to a modern React/TypeScript/Tauri/Capacitor stack.
*   Implement a robust offline-first architecture for field operations.
*   Establish a subscription-based business model for enterprise clients.

**Target Audience**
*   **Facility Managers:** Seeking autonomy and risk reduction.
*   **Forestry Service Providers:** Managing multiple clients professionally.
*   **Corporate Enterprises:** Requiring auditability and compliance.
