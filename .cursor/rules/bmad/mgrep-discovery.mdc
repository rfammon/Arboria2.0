# Search & Discovery Rule

CRITICAL: All agents MUST use the `mgrep` tool as the primary method for discovering files and searching for code patterns within this project.

## Instructions
1.  **Prioritize mgrep:** Before using `grep_search` or `find_by_name`, you SHOULD use `mgrep` (semantic search) to locate logic.
2.  **Semantic Context:** Use natural language queries in `mgrep` (e.g., `mgrep "where is the tree location handled?"`) to find relevant files.
3.  **Path Filtering:** Narrow down searches by providing specific directories if known (e.g., `mgrep "notification logic" src/hooks`).

This rule is mandatory to ensure all agents benefit from the semantic indexing provided by Mixedbread AI.
